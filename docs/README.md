# Kyto Docs

This `docs/` folder contains placeholder documentation for Kyto. The guides and API reference are in early stages and need expansion to match the current codebase.

## Current status

- Basic structure and links exist: `guides/` and `api/` directories are present, but many guides are TODO or incomplete.
- Recommended to add:
  - Getting started (local dev + env vars)
  - AI assistant usage and model setup notes
  - Collaboration and deployment migration guide (how to migrate to Durable Objects / D1)
  - Exported project examples and verification steps

## Contribution

Please open an issue or PR with documentation you'd like to add or improve.
