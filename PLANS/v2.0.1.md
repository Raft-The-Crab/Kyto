Kyto v2.0.1 — Biggest Update (Branding + Stability)

Goals
- Complete rebrand to "Kyto" (done across codebase)
- Improve platform stability: migrations, tests, CI, persistence
- Prepare for production migration: Durable Objects / D1 and Tauri packaging

Release pillars
1. Branding & UX polish (v2.0.1)
   - Apply consistent branding (Kyto, logos, colors)
   - Add BRANDING.md and AUTHORS.md (done)
   - Add migration helper to preserve user localStorage keys

2. Frontend improvements
   - Migrate localStorage keys (migration script) ✅
   - Add automated smoke tests & unit tests (Vitest) — target: core engine, export UI, AIHelper
   - Improve export flow: add preview & validation for exported code (syntax checks)
   - Integrations: add GitHub export (archive), Replit / Railway deployment helper buttons
   - Add analytics hooks for export/download events (opt-in)
   - Accessibility review & minor UI polish (no visual redesign)

3. Backend improvements
   - Add tests for API endpoints (projects, export, ai) using Vitest/supertest
   - Add optional Postgres persistence (already present) and migration scripts
   - Prepare Durable Object adapter (interface) and plan migration to Cloudflare Workers + D1
   - Add basic rate limiting & monitoring hooks

4. Dev tooling & CI
   - Add GitHub Actions: lint, type-check, test, build (frontend & backend) ✅
   - Add release workflow to tag and publish (semantic-release or manual)

5. Docs & Release notes
   - Update READMEs (branding, status) ✅
   - Add CHANGELOG entry for v2.0.1 (migration notes, breaking changes like storage keys)

Task breakdown (priority order)
- High (next sprint)
  - Implement migration helper and run at bootstrap (frontend) — preserves user data ✅
  - Add CHANGELOG.md entry for v2.0.1 ✅
  - Add Vitest skeleton and 3 critical tests (export endpoint, projects API, AI suggest) — low-effort smoke tests
  - Add GitHub Actions for checks (lint, type-check, test)

- Medium
  - Export preview + validation UI and server-side export tests
  - Add small analytics/events for export and model download
  - Add Tauri packaging proposal (docs + script)

- Long term
  - Migrate collab & convo storage to Durable Objects + D1
  - Implement recommended monitoring & observability (logs, metrics)

Acceptance criteria
- Migration helper is executed once and maps old keys to new keys without data loss
- README and BRANDING files updated and include migration notes
- PR created that contains the above changes and is ready for review

Notes
- Consider a small telemetry opt-in to track migrations success rate
- Communicate migration clearly in the app (small banner) to reassure users
