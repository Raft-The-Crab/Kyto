# Botify Production Platform

Industrial-grade visual orchestration system for high-fidelity Discord infrastructure. Balanced, stable, and architected for professional bot development.

## Overview

Botify provides a unified environment for designing complex logical flows via a visual canvas, translating high-level components into production-grade source code. This is a proprietary development platform designed by **Raft-The-Crab**.

### Core Architecture

- **Visual Engine**: Reactive node-based environment powered by XYFlow (@xyflow/react).
- **Embedded IDE**: High-performance source code editing via Monaco Editor with custom industrial themes.
- **Transpilation Layer**: Real-time bi-directional synchronization between visual nodes and Discord.js/Discord.py source targets.
- **State Infrastructure**: High-speed localized persistence using Zustand and IndexedDB.

## Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: React 18 / TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 / HeroUI / Framer Motion
- **Runtime Target**: Node.js / Python Runtime
- **API Coverage**: Full Discord Gateway support (Voice, Threads, AutoMod, Scheduled Events)

## Deployment Pipeline

The platform utilizes a multi-stage deployment sequence for logic verification:

1.  **Transpilation**: Conversion of visual nodes to target language.
2.  **Validation**: Structural and logical checking against API constraints.
3.  **Synchronization**: Real-time push to Discord Gateway infrastructure.

## Access & Licensing

**Proprietary Software**. This repository and its associated builds are restricted.
